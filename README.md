# social-app
Followed one of Vlad Mihalcea's tutorials on Hibernate, implemented in Java 11 & Spring 2.1.1.

Designed as an example of the following:
- One to many entity mapping
- Controller - service - repository architecture
- Unit testing (mocking components)
- H2 in memory server configuration

In order to see mock data, run the app and send a **GET** request to `http://localhost:8080/api/posts`
